Sample text goes here, look, it's sample text in a paragraph wow.  I can't believe there's so much same text.
I wonder when we're going to see some code.

Here's some fake code:

    #!python
    class MyCollection(dict):
        def __init__(self):
            self.foo = "blah"

    def foo():
        print "woo!  Python things!"

Ok, this sample post is done.
