Look it's a sample post, which is amazing.  Ok, I really have nothing to say here, but I need to make a filler.

Here's some fake code:

    #!python
    class MyCollection(dict):
        def __init__(self):
            self.foo = "blah"

    def foo():
        print "woo!  Python things!"

Ok, this sample post is done.
